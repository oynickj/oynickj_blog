              Hey! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Josh and this is my personal page. I'm a <a href="https://github.com/oynickj" target="_blank" title="Check out my Github">developer</a>, <a href="https://foursquare.com/oynickj" target="_blank" title="Foursquare">borough adventurer</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23636412-josh-oynick" target="_blank" title="Goodreads">lifelong student</a>, and believer that the most important things in life are to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e35SVmdx9nY" target="_blank" title="The great Conan O'Brien">work hard and be kind</a>. I was born and raised in Sarasota, Florida, and my parents are both from Mexico City, so I grew up speaking Spanish and eating Mexican Jewish food.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey as a developer began in the fall of 2013, when I enrolled in General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">Web Development Immersive</a> program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before that, I was an investment banking analyst at UBS and Greentech Capital Advisors, where I worked with companies in the renewable energy and infrastructure sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 2011 with concentrations in Finance and Operations and Information Management. At Penn, I was in a musical comedy group called the <a href="http://www.maskandwig.com/" target="_blank">Mask and Wig Club</a> where I performed in the cast and played drums, guitar, keys, and sometimes the shaker in the band.

              <p class="description"> Granulr is group project created during General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. Built with Javascript, Ruby, and Rails, Granulr facilitates goal setting and achievement through a "user stories" model and allows users to break down large goals into specific, actionable tasks. I'm currently using Granulr to help me as I train for my first half marathon in March 2014. </p>

              <p class="description">Getadilla, my first project, is an online ordering portal for a quesadilla restaurant. Inspired by my love for the world's greatest food, the app is built with Rails and incorporates login and authentication, as well as Google Translate functionality.</p>

              <img src="images/finddafoods.png" alt="finddafoods" class="screenshot">
              <p class="description"> This project was my first foray into the awesome worlds of the Foursquare API and the D3.js JavaScript library. I love traveling and finding cool places to visit, so I wanted an app that allows users to find out which venues have the most checkins based on a city and category of their choice.</p>
